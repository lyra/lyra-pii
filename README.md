# Sentry Clients

## What for?
Sentry is an Error Tracking Software. \
All Lyra apps can freely integrate to the On-premise Sentry instance. \

Sentry already provides [official Client SDK](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/). \
But to enforce Lyra Security and Convention rules, we extend and wrap them in Lyra dedicated libraries.
